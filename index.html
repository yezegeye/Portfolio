                            <p> As part of a cybersecurity exploration initiative, I conducted a comprehensive buffer overflow attack given access to a
                                 very basic low level representation of a computer in the form of a repository. The project deepened my understanding of 
                                 call stack organization, procedure call abstraction, and stack discipline implementation. By crafting exploit strings and 
                                 executing buffer overrun attacks, I gained insights into the far-reaching security implications of system design choices, 
                                 particularly in environments lacking memory safety enforcement. This project not only honed my technical skills but also 
                                 underscored the critical importance of cybersecurity measures in safeguarding vital software systems across various sectors. </p>

                            <p>“What’s your major?” This is a question that so many have been asked. However, 
                                there seems to be a correlation between the race and gender of the person being 
                                questioned and what major the person asking is expecting to hear. This paper explores
                                the presence of this bias in the GPT-J Language Model (predecessor of the now publicly accessible 
                                Chat-GPT) through scripting existing LLM programs and a series of targeted probe tasks.
